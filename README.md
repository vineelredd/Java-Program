# 🎯 MAD Libs Game (Java)

This is a simple **MAD Libs Game** written in Java.  
The program prompts the user to enter a few words (adjectives, noun, and verb) and then uses them to generate a funny story.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program asks the user to input:
   - Three adjectives  
   - One noun  
   - One verb ending with `-ing`
2. It then creates a short story using those inputs.

---

## 💻 Example Output

**Input:**
Enter an Adjective (description): beautiful
Enter a Noun (Animal or person): tiger
Enter an Adjective (description): strong
Enter a verb end with -ing: jumping
Enter an Adjective (description): surprised


**Output:**
Today I went to a beautiful zoo.
In an exhibit, I saw a tiger.
Tiger was strong and jumping.
I was surprised!

# 🛒 Shopping Cart - Java Console Application

## 📘 Overview
The **Shopping Cart** is a simple **Java console-based program** that allows users to simulate buying items by entering the item name, price, and quantity. The program then calculates and displays the total cost dynamically for each purchase.

This project helps beginners understand:
- Basic Java syntax  
- Using the `Scanner` class for user input  
- Performing simple arithmetic operations  
- Working with loops and data types  

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Accepts user input for:
- Item name  
- Item price  
- Quantity  

✅ Automatically calculates:
- Total cost = `price × quantity`  

✅ Displays:
- Purchase summary with currency format  

✅ Runs continuously until the user manually stops (infinite loop).  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Loops (`while(true)`)
- Input handling using `Scanner`
- Data types: `String`, `double`, `int`, `char`
- String concatenation and formatted output

---

## 🖥️ Example Output
What item would you like to buy?: Apple
What is the price for each?: 2.5
How many would you like?: 4
You have bought 4 Apple
Your total is $10.0
