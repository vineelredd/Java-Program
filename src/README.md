# 🎯 MAD Libs Game (Java)

This is a simple **MAD Libs Game** written in Java.  
The program prompts the user to enter a few words (adjectives, noun, and verb) and then uses them to generate a funny story.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program asks the user to input:
   - Three adjectives  
   - One noun  
   - One verb ending with `-ing`
2. It then creates a short story using those inputs.

Enter a Noun (Animal or person): tiger
Enter an Adjective (description): strong
Enter a verb end with -ing: jumping

In an exhibit, I saw a tiger.
